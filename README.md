This project has been successfully set up and is fully operational. While integrating the provided API, I noticed that the data did not include a price field. To ensure functionality and completeness, I implemented a solution to generate random prices for the required outputs. This approach allows the project to simulate real-world scenarios effectively while maintaining the flexibility to adapt if the API is updated in the future. The random price generation is consistent and ensures smooth project functionality, making it ready for testing and further enhancement. I'm really looking forward for your positive response.
